          Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment rather than
          practicing the way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an enlightened being
          who spread his philosophy far and wide, preaching and changing and
          influencing the world and his actions live on to this day.

          Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply meditate.
          The idea is to relinquish attachment to earthly desires in order to DO
          MORE. Not to meditate all day to do nothing. In an effort of learning
          all teachings, we will re-evaluate the core values, and give a new
          perspective based on the teachings. The core re-evaluation leads us to
          the idea that Nirvana is something to achieve in this realm.

          To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is failed to
          be recognized by modern Buddhist society. Outreach is a non-factor. So
          many people who need this valuable information are left in the dark,
          with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual progress using technology
          (tools to increase impact) are completely disregarded.

        <div className="conclusionPoints">
          Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to renounce. But
          here’s what the true text says “Desires for tangible things (such as
          wealth, property, or other material goods) or for pleasures of the
          body (such as sexual activity, gluttony, or other hedonistic
          pursuits).

        <div className="conclusionPoints">
          Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not even
          know how consciousness works yet. To learn all teachings, we need to
          learn by the act of doing. There is no better thing to learn at this
          time, than how to spread change like Buddha did.

          “In Buddhism, enlightenment (called bodhi in Indian Buddhism, or
          satori in Zen Buddhism) is when a Buddhist finds the truth about life
          and stops being reborn because they have reached Nirvana.” In order to
          stop the cycle of rebirth, we must stop the death to life cycle.
