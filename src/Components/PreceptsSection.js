                creature. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to nurture a mind of

                rescue and protect all beings. If instead, he fails to restrain

                A disciple of the Buddha must not engage in licentious acts or

                their mothers, daughters, sisters, or other close relatives, he
                commits a Parajika offense.

                well. If instead, he causes wrong speech, wrong views or evil

                Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist
